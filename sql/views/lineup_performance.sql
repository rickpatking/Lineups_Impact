-- LINEUP PERFORMANCE VIEWS FOR POWER BI ANALYSIS
-- ============================================================================
-- This file creates SQL views that calculate advanced basketball metrics
-- for lineup analysis in Power BI or Tableau
-- ============================================================================

-- VIEW 1: lineup_stint_stats
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PURPOSE: Calculate points scored and allowed for each lineup stint
--
-- HOW IT WORKS:
-- 1. For each lineup stint (period where same 5 players are on court)
-- 2. Join with play-by-play data to get all events during that stint
-- 3. Calculate points scored (shots made by the lineup's team)
-- 4. Calculate points allowed (shots made by opponent)
-- 5. Calculate possessions (estimated using a standard NBA formula)
--
-- WHY: This is the foundation for all lineup analysis. We need to know
-- how many points a lineup scores vs allows to measure their effectiveness.

-- For example: "The Curry-Thompson-Green-Wiggins-Looney lineup has played
-- 45 minutes with a +15.3 net rating"

-- 4. The difference shows that player's impact
--
-- WHY: Answers "How much better is the team when Player X is playing?"
